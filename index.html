      I develop test softwares that caters to the electrical and mechanical testing of automotive cables.
      As part of the job once a test software is released, I train techniciancs and Engineers on how to use the particular solution.
      Lastly, during production run I help the plant debug problems that occurs on the test set-up and properly document the solution and the cause for the problem.
